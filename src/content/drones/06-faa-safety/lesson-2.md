When operating a drone, many regulations must be met to ensure safety of the operator and the drone. A few key requirements are listed below; however, a more comprehensive list is available from the Federal Aviation Administration.

## 10 Key Rules

### 1. Keep Drone in Sight

You need to be able to see the drone the whole time when you are flying. Not too far away, and not on the other side of large objects.

### 2. Give Way to Planes

If you are flying and see another plane flying by, you are responsible for moving out of the way from the plane or any other flying aircraft. You do not have the right of way.

### 3. Fly One Drone at a Time

One person can only fly one drone. Two people cannot fly one drone, and one person cannot fly two drones.

### 4. No Reckless Flying

Do not fly recklessly. Just like operating a car, drones need to be flown carefully and purposefully.

### 5. Maximum Altitude

- Cannot fly higher than 400 feet above the ground
- If you are flying above a building, you are allowed to fly 400 feet above the building
- Regardless of if you are flying 400 feet above the ground or a building, you must be a minimum of 500 feet below the clouds and 2000 feet horizontally away from the clouds

### 6. Maximum Speed

Do not exceed 100 miles per hour

### 7. Flight Time

You may fly your drone for 30 minutes before the sunrise and 30 minutes after sunset during civil twilight. If you have specialized FAA approved lighting on the drone, then you may request exceptions to this regulation.

### 8. Maximum Distance Between Drone and Pilot

You must be able to always see the drone. Often you will lose sight of the drone before it is 3 miles away, in which case you should return the drone closer to a point you can see the drone.

### 9. Do Not Fly Over People

Do not fly over a group of people at a sporting event or a crowd of people in any other setting.

### 10. Do Not Fly From Moving Vehicles

You are also not allowed to fly a drone when you are in a moving vehicle like a boat or a car unless you are in a sparsely populated area.

## Airspace Classes

The FAA has established different regulated airspace classes. You are allowed to fly a drone within the previously discussed regulations in Class G Airspace. However, you can be allowed to fly in other restricted airspace classes by contacting the regulator of the airspace of interest.
