NDVI is one of many vegetation index formulas that use specific reflectance values that can be used to determine plant health. NDVI stands for: **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index**.

## NDVI Formula

**NDVI = (NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)**

## Interpreting NDVI

Once calculated:

- A **high NDVI** signals healthy plants
- A **low NDVI** signals stressed plants
- A **very low NDVI** value indicates no plants are present and is a sign of bare soil

NDVI values typically range from -1 to +1:
- **0.6 to 0.9:** Very healthy vegetation
- **0.3 to 0.6:** Moderate vegetation
- **0.1 to 0.3:** Stressed vegetation
- **Below 0.1:** Bare soil or no vegetation
