<div class="lesson-intro">
  <p>A drone is a flying robot that can be controlled by the user or programmed to fly on its own. In agriculture, drones help farmers see their fields from above and detect problems early.</p>

## Key Definitions

<div class="definitions-grid">
  <div class="definition-card">
    <h3>UAV</h3>
    <p class="card-label">Unmanned Aerial Vehicle</p>
    <p class="card-description">The drone itself—the physical aircraft equipped with sensors and cameras</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="definition-card">
    <h3>UAS</h3>
    <p class="card-label">Unmanned Aerial System</p>
    <p class="card-description">The complete system including the drone, controller, sensors, pilot, and software working together</p>

## Agricultural Applications

<p class="section-intro">While fields may appear healthy from ground level, drones provide a critical aerial perspective that reveals problems invisible to the naked eye.</p>

    <h4>Locate Stressed Areas</h4>
    <p>Identify regions in the field experiencing stress that aren't visible from the ground</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="benefit-card">
    <div class="benefit-number">2</div>
    <h4>Diagnose the Cause</h4>
    <p>Determine what is causing the stress—disease, pest damage, irrigation issues, or nutrient deficiency</p>
  </div>
  
  <div class="benefit-card">
    <div class="benefit-number">3</div>
    <h4>Quantify the Impact</h4>
    <p>Measure the extent of the problem to inform treatment decisions and predict yield loss</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="impact-callout">
  <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
  <p>Even fields that appear healthy at ground level may be losing significant amounts of money each year due to undetected yield losses. Using specialized sensors to calculate vegetation indices provides a different perspective, enabling farmers to detect problems early, make informed decisions, and optimize crop performance.</p>
