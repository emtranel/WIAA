Have You Used AI Before? How Can AI Be Helpful?

## AI (Artificial Intelligence) is technology that can:

- Recognize patterns in data
- Learn from examples
- Make decisions
- Process large amounts of information quickly

## Why AI Matters for Farmers

**Without AI:** Farmer walks 500 acres = 10-20 hours of work

**With AI:** Drone captures 1,200 images, AI analyzes in seconds

AI can help farmers to identify the type of stress, determine the level of stress, the severity of the stress, and predict how the stress will act in the future.

## Types of AI

- **Machine Learning:** AI that learns patterns from data
- **Deep Learning:** AI that uses neural networks similar to human brains
- **Generative AI:** A type of deep learning that can understand and create plain language (large language models), and interpret images with plain language generation (vision language models)
