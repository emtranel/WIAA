AI requires a process of training the computer to understand what we know, so it can analyze data quickly and be used to help users in real-world applications.

## The AI Development Process

1. **Data is collected** - Gather images, measurements, and observations
2. **Data is labeled by humans** - Ensure the data is accurate through human expertise
3. **The model is trained** - Use the labels to learn the meaning of the data
4. **The model is tested** - Ensure the model is performing accurately
5. **The model is deployed** - Use in the field for real-world applications

Throughout this process, AI developers may learn new things about the data, methods used in training, or new technology, so the process forms a development cycle for continual improvements.

## Human-in-the-Loop

The human element is especially important during the labeling phase. Domain experts can use their knowledge to label data accurately and precisely so the model is trained on quality data and is more likely to perform precisely and accurately in real-world conditions.
