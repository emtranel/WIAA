Different AI tools can be applied to specific tasks in agriculture.
## Vision Models
- **Purpose:** Identify and locate objects in images
- **Example:** Find all weeds in a field
## Classification Models
- **Purpose:** Sort and organize information
- **Example:** Is this a grasshopper or a ladybug?
## Quantification Models
- **Purpose:** Provide specific numbers and measurements
- **Example:** Count 47 Japanese beetles in this image
## Prediction Models
- **Purpose:** Analyze patterns and predict future outcomes
- **Example:** This pest will reproduce in 5 days based on temperature
## Language & Explanation Models
- **Purpose:** Generate explanations and understand natural language
- **Example:** Explain why this plant is diseased based on visual analysis
## Multimodal Models
These models can be used independently from each other, but they become more helpful when they are combined. When these models are combined, they create **multimodal models** to solve problems that require multiple AI tools.

Maybe we want to upload an image to our model and have it tell us what the pest species is and how many of each species are present in the image. Vision, classification and quantification models would be combined into one multimodal model.
## Agentic AI Systems
Multimodal models can also be combined with external data to create an **agentic AI system**. If the vision, classification, and quantification models were combined with external data such as air temperature and lifecycle data, the agentic AI system could be used to determine when the pest species might reproduce in real time.
## Learning Activities
- Use PestIDBot to identify weeds using AI
